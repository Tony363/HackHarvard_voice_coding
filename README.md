## Inspiration

The Rubber Ducky will always be close to every programmers heart. This project is a tribute to the loyal companion who never failed to alleviate the anxieties and distress of our early programming careers. Our Rubber Ducky is designed to be both an entertaining fidget toy and a visualization tool for a bewildered programmer.

## What it does

The Rubber Duck listens to you and illustrates your ideas comprehensively in the shape of diagrams. By the end of the process, you will have a well-documented chart of ideas and classes for your many programming projects.

## How we built it

The Rubber Ducky consists of 4 main components. These components are the voice-to-text interface, the text parsing middleware, the class object visualizer, the class object code recommendation system, and the cyber-physical energetic Rubber Duck right by your side in your time of need. Google's Speech to text API is implemented to render user utterances into Text. These texts will then be parsed into comprehensive class object method signatures that reduce the sample problem into simple object methods. Using these simple object methods, a class diagram will be visualized for the user accompanied by state-of-the-art code snippet recommendations.

## Challenges we ran into

- Procuring a reliable and robust speech-to-text model that can correctly interpret user audio
- Parameterizing GPT-2 generative code auto-completions for more generalized coding languages

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- Transition from text to diagram

## What we learned

- The use of Google Clouds Speech-to-text API
- Training GPT-2 model
- Automatic diagram generation
- Threading

## What's next for The Rubber Ducky that actually listens

The "Rubber Ducky that actually listens" aims to spread joy as a potential solution that enables growth in early coders. With future enhancements, the "Rubber Ducky that actual listens" looks to assist the physically impaired but mentally able to create and produce with speech. This Rubber Ducky is not only a programmer yearned development tool, but may be the first of many similar to come
